<summary>What I learned from reading case studies</summary>
<br>
Analysing data is time consuming and need effort. Before blindly touching given data set it is really important to understand the problem really well. If x is your problem and you are finding a solution for y then I think we all are wasting time and effort. It is very important to put the effort in the right direction. So here is what I understand from reading a case study of 'yammer'- a communication platform for companies. I got this case study from mode analytics. Found it really helpful.

<summary>15/08/2022 - Analyze International Debt Statistics</summary>
<br>
Today I have done a sql project. I completed 'Analyze International Debt Statistics'. It was a project listed in Data camp which is a very good platform for learning data science and analytics. I have made a jupiter note book. I will update the same in the upcoming days with added insights and summary. In a nutshell the project contained 9 questions, given data put lights on the world debt percentage by each countries. I used mysql work bench for writing queries. Listed the same in a jupyter note book but the story telling part needs much more improvement. I will work on it.

<summary>17/08/2022 - Struggle is Real </summary>
<br>
It was a really difficult day for me. Now the time is 2.37 A.M. I was trying to install jupyter notebook by myself in my localhost and connecting the same with sql for my project documentation. The first part went really well. But connecting sql with notebook was a pain in my a**. I struggled a lot. But thanks to me for my dedication finally I made it. But I am sorry I coudn't start documentation as it is almost 3 in the morning. I want a sleep. Almost 7 hours of struggle and reading documentation were required for me to troubleshoot the issue. Between don't use a @ in your SQL password you can thank me later 😆😆. I will upload my notebook file along with it. It is untitled 4. 
Fun fact:1,2,3 were there but I am not going to upload that

Good Morning 😂
